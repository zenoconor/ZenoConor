I soon found a new father in the English man who helped raise my two siblings and I in the Scottish Borders. My mother worked as a sculptor and artist, whilst my father worked as a business man, both of whom influenced and encouraged me greatly in my artistic ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">By the age of five I had moved to five different houses in three different places. This helped strengthen my visual memory as I was forced to find a way to make sense of these changes. I was exposed to a huge variety of places, situations, artists and interesting individuals who I will remember forever and who have helped mould the mind I have today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">I was raised as a Catholic from an early age and remember being fully engulfed in the philosophies and teachings of the bible. Despite this, I now view the world from a more scientific perspective, while maintaining interest and value in all philosophical and religious texts. At the age of 11 we stopped going to church and I started questioning religion, life, adults, education and everything else. My philosophical brain was born and has been on an unstoppable rampage ever since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">I started painting and selling paintings not long after this at the age of 12. I became obsessed with writing, socialising, sports, illusions, business, technology, marketing and philosophies. At age 21, I changed my name to Zen (previously Conor Moorehead), keeping the name Conor for a surname, and with the early signs of a failing economy in sight I decided to invest my time in studying something that seemed stable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">I studied animation and art in Dundee (Scotland) for four years in which most of my time was in fact devoted to various business ventures, part funded by my student grant, loans and overdraft given to me for my studies. By the end of University I was worse at art than when I had started and my mind and body were dismayed at the thought of doing any of the mundane jobs left available to me. I moved immediately, using the proceeds of my investments to go to Italy where I began studying at the Angel Academy of Art in Florence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\">After completeing further studies in both France and Belgium I moved to Boston where I currently reside. I built a studio and divide my time between various art activities, trying to further hone my skills and absorb as much of the art scene and culture of Boston and America as possible. I will be returning to my birth place to teach painting at the Academy of Realist Art in Edinburgh next year and am looking forward to further developing my work as well as having the oportunity to pass on some of the many skills I have gained throughout my travels.</p>\n","stylesMapId":"CK_EDITOR_PARAGRAPH_STYLES","linkList":[]},"c18l8":{"type":"StyledText","id":"c18l8","metaData":{"isPreset":false,"schemaVersion":"1.0","isHidden":false},"text":"<h2 class=\"alignLeft     font_2\" style=\"line-height: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.4em;\">ZEN O'CONOR - Bio</span></h2>\n","stylesMapId":"CK_EDITOR_PARAGRAPH_STYLES","linkList":[]},"c1zpt":{"type":"Page","id":"c1zpt","metaData":{"isPreset":false,"schemaVersion":"1.0","isHidden":false},"title":"BIO","hideTitle":true,"icon":"","descriptionSEO":"","metaKeywordsSEO":"","pageTitleSEO":"Zen O'Conor Art","pageUriSEO":"bio","hidePage":true,"underConstruction":false,"tpaApplicationId":0,"pageSecurity":{"requireLogin":false},"indexable":false,"isLandingPage":false,"pageBackgrounds":{"desktop":{"custom":true,"ref":"#customBgImg1zey","isPreset":false},"mobile":{"custom":true,"ref":"#customBgImg1o5f","isPreset":true}}},"customBgImg1o5f":{"type":"BackgroundMedia","id":"customBgImg1o5f","metaData":{"isPreset":false,"schemaVersion":"2.0","isHidden":false},"color":"{color_11}","alignType":"top","fittingType":"legacy_tile","scrollType":"fixed"},"customBgImg1zey":{"type":"BackgroundMedia","id":"customBgImg1zey","metaData":{"isPreset":false,"schemaVersion":"2.0","isHidden":false},"color":"{color_11}","alignType":"top","fittingType":"legacy_tile","scrollType":"fixed"}},"design_data":{},"behaviors_data":{},"connections_data":{},"theme_data":{},"component_properties":{}},"title":"BIO","pageUriSEO":"bio"}
